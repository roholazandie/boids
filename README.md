## What is Boids?
Boids is an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds which simultes the flocking behaviour of birds.As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

* separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
* alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
* cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
